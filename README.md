A Spam Detection System is an intelligent classification tool that automatically identifies and filters out unwanted, irrelevant, or harmful messages from legitimate communication. The system’s primary goal is to protect users from spam, phishing attempts, and malicious content, while ensuring genuine messages are delivered without delay.

In this project, we focus on text-based spam filtering for email or SMS messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The workflow involves:

Data Collection – Using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam (“ham”) messages.

Text Preprocessing – Cleaning messages by lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenizing words.

Feature Extraction – Converting text into numerical form using Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF vectorization.

Model Training – Applying machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to learn patterns of spam messages.

Evaluation – Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.

Deployment – Integrating the trained model into an application or service that can process real-time messages.

Key Role of Naive Bayes Classifier:
The Naive Bayes algorithm is particularly well-suited for spam detection because it is efficient, handles high-dimensional sparse data effectively, and performs well even with relatively small training datasets. It works by calculating the probability of a message being spam based on the occurrence of words in the message, assuming feature independence.

Applications:

Email spam filtering

SMS spam blocking

Social media comment moderation

Fraud and phishing prevention
